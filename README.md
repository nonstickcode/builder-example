# Builder Example

This project demonstrates how to set up and run a Next.js application integrated with Builder.io, without using Tailwind CSS, a `src/` directory, or the App Router. The setup process involves creating a new Next.js app, configuring it with TypeScript, ESLint, and customizing the default import alias. Then, it details integrating Builder.io into the application.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. This project was bootstrapped with the following major tools:

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- ESLint
- Builder.io

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the app up and running on your local machine:

1. **Create a Next.js App:** Start by creating a new Next.js application using the `create-next-app` command. You'll be prompted to answer a few questions regarding the setup. Name your project `builder-example`, opt for TypeScript, ESLint, and specify your preferences for not using Tailwind CSS, not using a `src/` directory, and not using the App Router.

2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory:** After creation, change into your project directory.

3. **Integrate Builder.io:** Initialize Builder.io integration to install dependencies and update `next.config.mjs` as needed.

4. **Run the Development Server:** Start the development server. This will compile your application and make it available at http://localhost:3000. You're now ready to start developing your application with Next.js and Builder.io!

## Next Steps
